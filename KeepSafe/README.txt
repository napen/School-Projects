KeepSafe was my undergraduate senior design project where my team created a self locking package box using a raspberry pi and a sensor suite. Code portion and PDF final report of completed project.

Entire Project Abstract:
With E-commerce quickly becoming one of the most popular forms of shopping, many people are getting more and more packages per day. 
When the packages are delivered to the doorstep of a house, they are sitting in the wide open for anyone to grab and unfortunately many people lose their beloved packages to theft every year. 
There are some options currently available but require either the delivery driver to have a special scanner or enter a person’s home or garage. 
Our team plans on solving this issue with our product, KeepSafe. 
KeepSafe is a smart package locker with two compartments that are unlocked until a package is placed into one of the compartments.
The locker will recognize the presence of a package from the sensor system inside, alert the user using the KeepSafe app, and then lock the box from any porch pirates. 
All the functions of KeepSafe will be performed by the Wi-Fi connected microcontroller that communicates with the user application and controls the various components inside each compartment. 
The user will then be able to unlock the package door with the app or the backup keypad. We will do extensive testing on our prototype for reliability of use, physical security, and ease of use. 
KeepSafe’s goal is to be user friendly but also the delivery driver so that the product will be utilized to its full extent. 
We intend to have KeepSafe be placed outside of residential homes, but it could be used for apartments or any small-scale deliveries that are left outside.
