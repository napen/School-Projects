This 32 Bit MIPS project is one I created as a group project for my design of VLSI Circuits in the first semester of my graduate studies. The team created a 32 Bit MIPS processor in Verilog with included enhancements of pipelining and a write through datacache and then synthesized it on a DE2-115 education board which has an Alterra Cyclone IV FPGA.

My duties for the project were to create the base structure of the processor and then pipeline the entire design. Since I did not take a formal computer organization class in my studies, I learned a lot about the MIPS processor design on the fly and got to fully understand every component of the processor.

Then once syntehsized on the FPGA, the team utilized the function on the board to display pipeline stages and the program counter using the seven segment display and the built-in LEDs.
